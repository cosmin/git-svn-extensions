Description: git-svn-extensions are a set of shell scripts that make it easier 
to work with subversion from git.

* Installation *

The current extensions are written as a set of bash functions. Simply add the
following line to your .bashrc, .bash_profile or similar to take advantage of
these features:

. /path/to/this/project/source.sh

* Usage *

- creating a subversion branch or tag

  $ git-svn-create-branch branch_name
  $ git-svn-create-tag tag_name

  This will create a branch in svn with that name, starting from the currently
  tracked remote (trunk or a svn branch), and check it out locally as
  svn-branch_name

  The tag creation does the same, with the differences that it aborts if the
  local branch contains unmerged changes, and at the end it does not checkout
  the remote tag into a new local branch, since tags are not normally edited.

- deleting a subversion branch or tag

  $ git-svn-delete-branch branch_name
  $ git-svn-delete-tag tag_name

  By default this only shows what would be deleted (dry run). Append -f to
  actually delete.

- removing references to remote branches and tags that no longer exist in svn

  $ git-svn-prune-branches
  $ git-svn-prune-tags

  By default this only shows what would be deleted (dry run). Append -f to
  actually delete.

- list svn branches or tags (excluding trunk)

  $ git-svn-branches
  $ git-svn-tags

- show the current local and remote branch names

  $ git-current-branch
  $ git-current-remote-branch

  The latter correctly detects if the local branch tracks the trunk, a branch,
  or a tag. Append -s to only print the name of the branch/tag, or "trunk"
  instead of the user-friendly message.
